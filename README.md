# ClassroomMLBehaviorAnalysis with YOLOv8 and Ultralytics

This project uses machine learning with Python, integrating YOLOv8 from Ultralytics for behavior analysis, specifically in exam halls. The model can be trained using datasets sourced from Roboflow or your own custom dataset.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Ensure Python is installed. Install necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

#### Video Inference

To run YOLOv8 inference on a video, follow these steps:

1. Import necessary libraries:

```python
import cv2
from ultralytics import YOLO
```

2. Load the YOLOv8 model:

```python
model = YOLO(r"C:\\Users\\ndgow\\runs1\\detect\\yolov8n_custom19\\weights\\best.pt")
```

Replace `"C:\\Users\\ndgow\\runs1\\detect\\yolov8n_custom19\\weights\\best.pt"` with the path to your trained YOLOv8 model.

3. Open the video file:

```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("C:\\Users\\ndgow\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\y2mate.com - CCTV footage of malpractices in the Departmental Examination of Postal Department_480p.mp4")
```

Replace `"C:\\Users\\ndgow\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\y2mate.com - CCTV footage of malpractices in the Departmental Examination of Postal Department_480p.mp4"` with the path to your video file.

4. Process video frames and run inference:

```python
while cap.isOpened():
    # Read a frame from the video
    success, frame = cap.read()

    if success:
        # Run YOLOv8 inference on the frame
        results = model(frame)

        # Visualize the results on the frame
        annotated_frame = results[0].plot()

        # Display the annotated frame
        cv2.imshow("YOLOv8 Inference", annotated_frame)

        # Break the loop if 'q' is pressed
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
            break
    else:
        # Break the loop if the end of the video is reached
        break

# Release the video capture object and close the display window
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

5. Run the script and view the annotated video frames. Press 'q' to exit.

### Customization

Adjust paths and parameters (like model paths and video file paths) in the provided code snippets according to your project's setup and requirements.

This README file provides instructions for running YOLOv8 inference on a video using OpenCV, guiding users through setup, usage, and customization of the YOLOv8 model for behavior analysis in exam halls. Adjust the specifics to match your project's configuration and ensure all paths are correctly set before running the script.
